# Night Shadow

Night Shadow: a theme with a dark color scheme that fully modifies the appearance of Firefox browser far beyond the built-in customization features.

### Firefox advanced customization with CSS

Firefoxâ€™s user interface is built of web-like elements (HTML and XUL elements) and styled using CSS. Thus, In addition to the built-in Customize features, Firefox themes and other types of add-ons, there are additional options for changing the appearance (user interface) of Firefox browser by applying style rules with an optional files named [userChrome.css](https://www.userchrome.org/) and userContent.css.

Using the aforementioned technique, the Night Shadow theme's color scheme is applied to all elements of the Firefox interface (including, panels, internal windows etc.).
